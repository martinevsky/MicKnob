# MicKnob

A simple Windows-only app for mic control from the keyboard. Maps F20 to mute, F19 to volume up, and F18 to volume down.

Useful with a [Keychron Q11](https://www.keychron.com/products/keychron-q11-qmk-custom-mechanical-keyboard) keyboard. Set your left knob settings as pictured below and enjoy!
